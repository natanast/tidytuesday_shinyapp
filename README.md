# TidyTuesday Shiny App
This Shiny app is an extension of my participation in the #TidyTuesday challenge, showcasing the visualizations and insights from my work. It provides a user-friendly way to engage with the #TidyTuesday challenge, whether you're looking for inspiration, examples, or insights into my data analysis journey.

TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project organized by the Data Science Learning Community. It encourages participants to explore and visualize real-world data sets, fostering a collaborative environment for data analysis and sharing insights.

Through this app, you can:

- Explore my #TidyTuesday visualizations.
- Access links to the original datasets and the corresponding code on GitHub.
